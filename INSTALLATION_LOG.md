# Karl Installation Progress Log

## Initial Setup and Dependency Installation Attempts

### Environment
- OS: Linux 6.8.0-49-generic
- Python Version: 3.10
- Working Directory: /home/dot/karl

### Installation Steps and Issues

1. Initial package installation attempt:
```bash
pip3 install eth-hash==0.2.0 eth-utils==1.9.0 requests==2.25.0 rlp==1.2.0 persistent==4.2.0 py-flags py-solc py-solc-x==1.0.0 pythx==1.6.1 transaction==2.2.1
```
- Status: Partially successful
- Issues: Some dependency conflicts noted

2. Additional dependencies installation attempt:
```bash
pip3 install plyvel py-evm==0.3.0a13 coincurve>=7.0.0 future pbkdf2 pyethash>=0.1.27,<1.0.0 pysha3>=1.0.1 PyYAML
```
- Status: Failed
- Issues: Problems with Rust-based dependencies

3. Numpy installation attempts:
```bash
pip3 install Cython && pip3 install numpy==1.19.0
```
- Status: Failed
- Issue: Incompatibility with Python 3.10

```bash
pip3 install numpy==1.21.5
```
- Status: Installed but with conflicts
- Issues: 
  - Mythril requires numpy==1.19.0
  - matplotlib requires numpy>=1.23
  - contourpy requires numpy>=1.23

### Current Challenges
1. Version compatibility issues between:
   - Python 3.10 and numpy 1.19.0
   - Different package requirements for numpy versions
2. Rust-based dependencies installation problems
3. Complex dependency tree with conflicting requirements

### Potential Solutions
1. Create a new virtual environment with Python 3.8
2. Modify dependencies to work with newer versions
3. Look for alternative versions of Karl that support newer Python versions

### Next Steps
- Decision needed on which approach to take for resolving the Python/numpy version conflicts
- Need to address Rust-based dependency installation issues
- Consider creating a more modern fork with updated dependencies
