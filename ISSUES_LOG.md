## Active Issues

### Issue #1: Python Version Compatibility
**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Current Python 3.10 environment is incompatible with required dependencies  
**Details**:
- numpy 1.19.0 (required by Mythril) doesn't support Python 3.10
- Attempted workaround with numpy 1.21.5 created new conflicts
- Affects core functionality

### Issue #2: Rust-Based Dependencies
**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Failed to build Rust-based dependencies  
**Details**:
- blake2b-py build fails due to Rust nightly requirement
- Affects core cryptographic functionality
- Blocking installation progress

### Issue #3: Dependency Version Conflicts
**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: Multiple conflicting package version requirements  
**Details**:
- numpy version conflicts between different packages:
  * Mythril requires numpy==1.19.0
  * matplotlib requires numpy>=1.23
  * contourpy requires numpy>=1.23
- Potential circular dependencies

## Resolved Issues
*No issues resolved yet*

## Proposed Solutions

### For Issue #1:
1. Create new virtual environment with Python 3.8
2. Test compatibility with all required packages
3. Document setup process for future reference

### For Issue #2:
1. Install Rust nightly toolchain
2. Attempt manual compilation of problematic packages
3. Look for pre-compiled alternatives

### For Issue #3:
1. Create dependency resolution map
2. Test package version combinations for compatibility
3. Consider forking and updating dependencies

## Next Actions
1. Set up Python 3.8 environment
2. Test installation process with new environment
3. Document successful/failed attempts
4. Update requirements.txt with compatible versions
